# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML Misuse

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the use of `innerHTML` in HTML.  Repeatedly modifying `innerHTML` without careful consideration can lead to performance degradation and unexpected behavior.  The bug is specifically showcased using a button that appends a paragraph to a div using innerHTML on each click.  The solution offers a more efficient and robust method to manage DOM updates.

## Bug

The primary issue is the inefficient and potentially problematic use of `innerHTML` within the `myFunction` to append new content to an existing element.  In scenarios with frequent updates, this approach becomes significantly less efficient than using DOM methods such as `appendChild` which are specifically designed for this purpose and manage the DOM updates more efficiently.

## Solution

The provided solution uses `createElement` and `appendChild` for a more efficient and safer way to update the DOM. This approach avoids the potential issues associated with repeated `innerHTML` modifications, making it significantly faster and more suitable for larger and more complex updates within the DOM tree.
